# Rotternews Directory
Includes a version of Rotternews prior to 0.51. 
That version was "live only" meaning every request to the application creates a request to the rotter.net site.

This directory exists for legacy reasons.

###The contents of these files have been migrated into Drupal to be used with Drush.###
See ``Drupal/rotternews/modules/custom/rotternews_base/include`` directory for updated files.
